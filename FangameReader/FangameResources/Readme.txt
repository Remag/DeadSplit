Fangame Death Counter v. 0.00

=============================================================

This is a program for tracking your death count for each boss attack.
The boss tracking starts when you press the reset button. The tracking ends when the Kid dies or when you reset during a fight.
The counter detects which fangame and boss to track automatically. You can use Ctrl-Left and Ctrl-Right to choose a different boss to track. 
Check out userSettings.ini for hotkeys and... well, user settings.

Redire made this :)

F.A.Q.
	
Q: How do I add a new fangame or change existing boss attacks?
A: Check out BossEditIntructions.txt for the information on how to add fangames and edit boss attacks.

Q: I try to capture the counter for my stream and the window shows up as a black rectangle. What do?
A: Seems to be a problem with Window Capture in OBS Studio. Use Game Capture or turn off Windows Aero.

Q: Can I use a different button to reset the counter?
A: Yes! You can add and change hotkeys in userSettings.ini. Note that the counter tracks physical key presses, so if you are using a software key remapper like AutoHotkey, you need to add the remapped button as well.
